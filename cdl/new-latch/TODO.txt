changeset: f92b3985b0 -- to check some lemma problem 19/8/15 introduce the flag "--old-base-case-unfold",
need to understand what this is used for.

Why need this flag to make the following entailment valid?
Why the split lemma is not triggered properly without using it?
maybe could start with search_lemma_candidates
==========================================================
//1: VALID
checkentail c::CNT<2> |- c::CNT<1> * c::CNT<1>.
print residue.
==========================================================
