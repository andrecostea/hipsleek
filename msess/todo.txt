it's now parsing, but fails at type check as below:

Message: **typeinfer.ml#1626: is neither 2 a data nor view name

Entail 1: EXCast. Failure("**typeinfer.ml#1626: is neither 2 a data nor view name")
Validate 1: Expecting1 FailBUT got no residue
------------------------------------------------

Sol:
(i)  unk preds are set to a dedicated view name: SESS_TEMP
(ii) while creating a heap node, set a proper session kind flag
(iii) use the session flag during iformula normalization
      to update the heap name approriately
(i) & (ii) are already implemented
(iii) partially implemented. To continue as below:
      call a transform for formula which in turn
      calls Session.IProjection.update_temp_heap_name
      to update the heap. 

=============================================
=============================================
change @ --> @s to flag a session formula inside
the HO arg list.
