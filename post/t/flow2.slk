Please see how termu-6.slk does it.

For each infer, can we push it somewhere that
can later be retrieved for fix-point?

Can we support infer_fixcalc under sleek to
invoked fixcalc directly?

Just need to collect relational assumptions:

 inferred rel: [RELDEFN P(__flow#E): ( P(x1) & x1+1=x) -->  P(x)]
 inferred rel: [RELDEFN P: ( (x+1)<=0) -->  P(x)]

After that collect a relational assumption with flow as follows:

 x+1<=0 & 3<=flow<=4  \/ P(x1,flow) & x1+1=x --> P(x,flow)

Fixcalc then give below but requires a separate
flow parameter:

 P(x,flow) == x+1<=0 & 3<=flow<=4
           == x+1<=0 & flow __norm
