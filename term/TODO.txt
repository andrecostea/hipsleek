1. Clean up EVariance and useless code of termination
2. DONE: Add call group (from proc_call_order of proc_decl)
3. Infer phase transition by inference mechanism
  - Filter irrelevant phase constraints
	- Make it work with interprocedural constraints (infer-3.ss), 
	may need logical vars
	- Integrate the result into specification
4. Prepare benchmarks and evaluation
5. Simplify the context to add useful constraints for
meaningful printing.
