 WHAT IS THIS?
 =============
 This is a discussion and implementation of AVL trees. The file
 DISCUSSION.txt contains a thorough discussion of AVL trees and their
 implementation. The rest of the files in this directory consist of
 source code and documentation for an AVL tree library written in C. The
 parent directory contains a C++ implementation of AVL trees. Please note
 that this implementation is not particularly efficient: It uses
 recursion instead of iteration and imposes some extra levels of
 indirection. Efficiency was sacrificed in favor of making the code easy
 to learn from and to understand. Once you understand the code you can
 implement your own optimizations.


 VERSION
 =======
 This is *not* really a formal software package. The code is intended
 more for instructional use than for production use. I guess Ill call
 this release version 2.0.
