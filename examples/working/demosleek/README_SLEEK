SLEEK entailment prover.

Overview:
--------------------------
HIP relies on the SLEEK prover in order to discharge the verification conditions. SLEEK is a fully automatic prover for separation logic with frame inferring capability. It takes as input two heap states represented by separation formulae, and checks if one formula (the antecedent) entails the other (the consequent). The antecedent may cover more heap states than the consequent, so a residual heap state which represents the frame condition can be returned by the prover. This residual heap state will include the pure state of the antecedent. SLEEK also supports instantiation of logical variables that appear during the entailment as existential variables in the consequent. As part of the implication check, SLEEK discharges the heap obligations, the obligations pertaining to the shape of data structures and translates the remaining pure obligations to pure constraints that can be discharged by theorem provers. The list of possible pure provers includes Omega , MONA , CVC Lite, Z3, and Isabelle.
