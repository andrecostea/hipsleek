- User-annotation via HIP

v@full denotes var will full access
v@value denotes var with copy access

pass-by-value -> v@value
pass-by-ref -> v@full

- Internal presentation:

{v1,..,vn}@zero which MAY have zero permission

- Convention:
(a) @zero for the main thread
    @full for the concurrent threads

(b) no two vars can be passed by ref to the same location

(c) when a parameter is given a pass-by-ref,the variable
     cannot be accessed until the thread has terminated

(d) for pass by value, a copy of the variable is passed to
     onwards; but the original location still have full access

- Rules

    v@zero  |- v@value --> fail
    v@zero  |- v@full --> fail

     not(v \in S)
  --------------------
  S@zero |- v@value  --> S@Z


         not(v \in S)
  -----------------------
  S@zero |- v@full  --> S+{v}@Z


- Approximation

  S1@zero and S2@full ==> (S1-S2)@zero 
  //concurrent thread

  S1@zero and S2@zero  ==> (S1 \cap S2)@zero 
  // this may not happen because concurrent threads
  // only capture @full

  S1@zero or  S2@zero  ==> (S1 \cup S2)@zero
