added memo_Pure re-patch;
      should do it more selectively

has assert been specialised?
  --> specialised on the fly

qsort
=====
 q is existential.. 
 prune baga conditions: (self,q)-163,(self)-162
 

use propagation and simplication for pruning conditions?

xform has redundancy (e.g. bugs/llrb5.slk)

A node with Derived became Original after lemma folding! which example?

view_unfold_num should be made into a verifier option

view_original should be changed from bool to integer
  0 -> original
  1,2,.. -> derived

(i) why are ante0,ante1 false for
  x::node<Anon_11@v>@M[Orig]&0<=v & v=@A & Anon_11=Anon_12&
  {FLOW,(19,20)=__norm}[]

!!!ann-bugs1a.slk:15: 35: ante0 : : false
!!!ann-bugs1a.slk:15: 35: ante1 : : false

(ii) need to carry v<=w_22 into the next conseq

!!!ann-bugs1a.slk:15: 35: heap_entail_empty_heap: rhs:
 0<=w_22 & w_22=@L
!!!ann-bugs1a.slk:15: 35: rhs_p : : 0<=w_22 & w_22=@L
