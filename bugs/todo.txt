use propagation and simplication for pruning conditions?

xform has redundancy (e.g. bugs/llrb5.slk)

A node with Derived became Original after lemma folding! which example?

view_unfold_num should be made into a verifier option

view_original should be changed from bool to integer
  0 -> original
  1,2,.. -> derived
