1. bi-*.slk are for bi-abduction, ex*.slk for classical entailment
2. ex1.slk for classical entailment, 35 test cases, all OK

3. bi-0.slk contains some very simple test cases for bi-abduction, bi1.slk with Or and And

4. bi-2.slk contains unfolding in RHS

5. bi-3.slk contains unfolding in LHS

TODO: check these cases, think about how to extract antiframe/frame.
