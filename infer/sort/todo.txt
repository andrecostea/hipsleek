# n-z-1d.ss

!!! REL POST :  R(res,x,y)
!!! POST:  x>=0 & y>=x & res=x
!!! REL PRE :  P(x,y)
!!! PRE :  0<=x & x<=y

PROBLEM : can we gist x>=0 away
 from both pre/post

# n-z-1d-1.ss

Why do we infer P when it is not in the selected var list.


# zip-n.ss

For below:
 RELASS [P]: ( P(a,b)) -->  (b!=0 | 2>a) & (b!=0 | a!=1),
Why did we not derived below instead:
 RELASS [P]: ( P(a,b)) -->  (b!=0 | a<=0)
