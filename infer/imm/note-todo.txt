1. change parser for <: and ann constants
   --> done

2. double check on imply_fast method

3. for every v:AnnT, add the constraint 0<=v<=2

4. convert inferred pre from int to v:AnnT for display

5. redlog conversion formula called even with default
   this is avoided when using -tp oc

6. mcpure and other files have missing patterns 
   AConst/SubAnn
