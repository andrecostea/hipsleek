/*

  deref_via_call2.c : assign into a local, but by passing it's address down a
  chain of function calls.

  This program should be safe: it should never assign *0=0.

  This was a test case to check frontend_slam's local declaration correctness:
  parent functions used to declare their child functions locals.

  This is the same as deref_via_call.c except that the address of the formal
  paramater of f is not taken.
