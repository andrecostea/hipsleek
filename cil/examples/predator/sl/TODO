- check size of integers when accessing them by pointers, warn if a signed int
  is accessed as unsigned and vice versa

- allow to convert nullified integers, pointers, and strings as long as the
  sizeof allows to perform the conversion safely; shout otherwise

- allow to represent (possibly unterminated) strings of fixed length at the
  level of memory chunks (intervals)

- allow to represent arrays of fixed lengths in the same way as list segments
  are represented (it would allow to create hash tables of fixed length)

- add support for execution of memmove()

- add support for memcpy(), issue an error if memcpy() is mistakenly used
  instead of memmove()

- get test-0707 from slayer working more efficient (we need to improve the join)

- trees in various forms that appear in real code

- support for non-pointer data needed to verify real code (find out what is in
  fact needed)

- choose some parts of applications and target them (for example drivers)

- create the test harness, maybe with some automation of the creation

- recursion at least for cut-point free programs

- analyze a non-recursive implementation of quicksort
