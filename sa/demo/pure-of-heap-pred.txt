For each heap predicate,
  HeapPred HP1(..).
  PostPred HP2(..).

We should internally create a corresponding pure 
relation:
  relation _pure_of_HP1(...).
  relation _pure_of_HP2(...).

After that, we should have a method which performs the
following

  pure_of_heap_pred :: h_formula --> formula_pure

  e.g. HP1(n)*HP2(w) ==>  _pure_of_HP1(n) & _pure_of_HP2(n)

  pure_relation_name_of heap_pred :: spec_var --> spec_var
      HP1 --> _pure_of_HP1

  heap_pred_name_of_pure_relation :: spec_var --> spec_var option
      _pure_of_HP1 --> Some HP1
